### Python Virtual Environments

Often it's meaningful to create an extra environment for a new big project. It helps to structure your local installations and to amange libarry installations.<br>
<br>
You need a python installation and have to install the virtual environment library: 
``` terminal
pip install virtualenv
```

<br>

Now you have to open a terminal (cmd) and have to navigate to the target location.<br>
Example naviagtion:
``` terminal
D:
cd "Projects/my new cool project"
```

Now you can easily create a new environment with the installed library, like: "". In env_name you can give it your name like ".env" or "project_name_env".:
``` terminal
python -m venv env_name

or in other words:
python<version> -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
```

<br>

You activate a virtual environment with going in the Scripts directory and type activate.bat. If the environment is activate you see the name of the environment on the left.<br>
On Windows:
``` terminal
cd env_name/Scripts
activate.bat
```

On Linux:
``` terminal
cd env_name/bin
source activate
```

Now you can install packages with pip and can use the virtual environment. With the command "pip list" you can check the current installings.
If you have a requirements.txt (a list of installations with version specification) you can type:
``` terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to generate a requirements.txt from a virtual environment, you type:
``` terminal
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

For deactivating the current virtual environment you simply type:
``` terminal
deactivate
```

### Ipynb to Markdown  

1. Installing the tools
  ``` terminal
pip install jupyter
pip install nbconvert
  ```

2. Start the cmd and go to the location of the notebook and type follow:
  ``` terminal
jupyter nbconvert --ClearMetadataPreprocessor.enabled=True --ClearOutput.enabled=True --to markdown README.ipynb
  ```

### Python Installation

**Python Installation under Windows**<br>
Download the exe installer file from the official Python website and follow the steps along. If you want to set it as new active environment, you should set the option to add to the PATH.<br>
Check the installation with opening a new CMD and type "python --version", now the installed version should appear.
<br><br>
**Python Installation on Linux** (unter Ubuntu 20.04)<br>

You can download and build the latest version of Python from the official Python website. It's pretty easy follow the steps and stay calm ;)<br>
Update your system's local repository list:<br>


```terminal
sudo apt update
```


Install supporting dependencies on your system with APT:

```terminal
sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev wget
```

Add important lib for some modules:
```terminal
sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev
```
(optional) For different TTS models you need espeak:
```terminal
sudo apt install espeak lzma liblzma-dev
```

Make a new directory to store the Python source files:

```terminal
mkdir /python && cd /python
```

Download the Python source code from the official FTP server:

```terminal
sudo wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.10/Python-3.8.10.tgz
```


Extract the TGZ file that you just downloaded:

```terminal
sudo tar -xvf Python-3.8.10.tgz
```


You need to perform tests and optimizations before installing Python. This is important as it increases the execution speed of your code by at least 10 percent:

```terminal
cd Python-3.8.10
sudo ./configure --enable-loadable-sqlite-extensions
```

Build the package using the MakeFile present in the directory:

```terminal
sudo make install
```


After you've implemented these steps, check if Python has been installed on your computer by typing **python3 --version** in the terminal.
